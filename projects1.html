	<<p>House is a clothing brand which currently has 290 stores in 11 European countries.
          This project called for the transformation of a small space within a former casino
          into a retail space suitable for a boutique. Although not listed,
          this 19th century building is located in a heart of conservation area
          within a UNESCO World Heritage Site and as such required a very
          respectful design approach on all project stages. The long list of
          strict requirements from the city's conservator, local building control
          and the building's inhabitants had to be met both during design
          and construction processes.<img src="images/1.jpg" />The successful space planning was achieved
          through the demolition of internal load bearing walls on the ground
          floor level which allowed the separated spaces to be opened up and
          interlinked in order to maximise the sales area. In addition to the complex
          internal fit-out works, the programme also included  the renovation of the facade,
          the replacement of all external windows, the re-positioning of
          an existing cash machine and the installation of new signage.
          The project was successfully completed on time and within budget,
          meeting challenging time lines which were necessitated due
          to the start of the peak shopping season.</p>
