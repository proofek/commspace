	   <p>House is a clothing brand which currently has 290 stores in 11 European countries.
	      This project called for the transformation of a small space within a former casino
	      into a retail space suitable for a boutique. Although not listed,
	      this 19th century building is located in a heart of conservation area
	      within a UNESCO World Heritage Site and as such required a very

	      strict requirements from the city's conservator, local building control
	      and the building's inhabitants had to be met both during design
	      and construction processes.The successful space planning was achieved
	      through the demolition of internal load bearing walls on the ground
	      floor level which allowed the separated spaces to be opened up and
	      interlinked in order to maximise the sales area. In addition to the complex
	      internal fit-out works, the programme also included  the renovation of the facade,
	      the replacement of all external windows, the re-positioning of
	      an existing cash machine and the installation of new signage.
	      The project was successfully completed on time and within budget,
	      meeting challenging time lines which were necessitated due
	      to the start of the peak shopping season.</p>

    <div id="case2">A retail unit in a new built shopping centre</div>
    <div id="case2desc">
        <p>Client: Artman S.A.<br/>
           Brand: House<br/>
           Location: Galaxy shopping centre, Szczecin<br/>
           Sales area: 240 sq.m</p>
        <p>Scope of services: Fit-out design and project management</p>
        <p>This is one of 15 similar and successfully completed shopping centre
           retail units for House. The scheme was to adopt and develop the model
           shop concept for this new retail complex. The main challenge was not
           one of design, as is typically the case for jobs of this nature,
           but one of organisation, with several teams working closely together
           with very tight deadlines.  The project had to be completed on site
           in seven weeks, two weeks before the mall's official opening.
           The successful completion was achieved through a combination of a
           strong professional team, appropriate organisational procedure
           and good communication.  Frequent site inspections were used and
           these ensured that a high quality of fit-out works was achieved
           even within the compressed time frame of the project.</p>

        <p>Client: Artman S.A.<br/>
           Brand: House<br/>
           Location: Olsztyn, the old town<br/>
           Sales area: 130 sq.m</p>
        <p>Scope of services: Fit-out design and project management</p>
        <p>This was a typical example of one of House's 18 franchised outlets.
           The scope of the project included the fit-out of premises,
           including finishes, fittings and equipment, lighting and HVAC.
           The main challenge for the architect was to adapt design standards
           to suit franchisee's premises, to co-ordinate installation
           works with supplies and to control the brand standards
           and quality of works on site. The success was achieved by good
           organisational procedures and close co-operation between
           the architect, client,  franchisee and their contractor.</p>
